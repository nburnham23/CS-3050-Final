# CS-3050-Final

Authored by Noah Burnham, Matthew Clark, Liam Spence, and Evan Stowell.

## Running the project
To play a game of chess, run the `Game.py` file. There are various modes to choose from: `two-player`, `easy AI`, and `hard AI`. The easy AI agent just chooses a random move, but the hard AI agent makes more calculated decisions. You can also customize the colors of the board by clicking the `set colors` button. 

## Chess Functionality
We have implemented all the functionality of a traditional game of chess -- even en passant and castling!

## Board Customization
At the main menu, you may enter the color customization menu to choose a color combination for your board. Select
a combination, then choose what game mode you would like the play and your board will be colored to your desire.

## Playing against the bot
If you'd like to play against our simple bot, choose the easy AI. This bot chooses its moves randomly. You should
have an easy time beating this one. If you want more of a challenge, choose the hard AI. This bot uses a minimax
algorithm to identify the optimal move at each turn.
