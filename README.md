# CS-3050-Final

Authored by Noah Burnham, Matthew Clark, Liam Spence, and Evan Stowell.

## Running the project
To play a game of chess, run the `Game.py` file. There are various modes to choose from: `two-player`, `easy AI`, and `hard AI`. The easy AI agent just chooses a random move, but the hard AI agent makes more calculated decisions. You can also customize the colors of the board by clicking the `set colors` button. 

## Chess Functionality
We have implemented all the functionality of a traditional game of chess -- even en passant and castling!
